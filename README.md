**This project marks the completion of my 2.5 months initial training into JS**

**_GOAL_**

Imitate the user registration process and shopping cart for an online shop selling paints.
Sites used to define the user flow: https://www.farrow-ball.com/, https://www.littlegreene.fr/

**_IN DETAIL_**

- Items: use methods class for items to define and calculate amount of paint necessary for user's renovation project
- Shopping cart: adding, updating and removing items

**_NOTE_**
